## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learned how to create a tooltip and more about absolute positioning. Besides that, I also became more familiar with Firefox's developer tools and different ways to check pseudo elements/classes in both Chrome and Firefox dev tools.

### Continued development

I'm still working to improve my absolute positioning skills, especially when scaling to different sizes. I also plan on learning how to manipulate SVGs in CSS and more about accessibility.
